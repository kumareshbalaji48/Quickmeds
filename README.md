### ðŸ“œ **NLP-Based Medical Summarizer**
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Details**:
  - Requires **setting up a billing account in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.
  - Create a **service account** for the project after enabling **Cloud Healthcare NLP**.
  - The backend processes the uploaded **medical reports** and provides a **layman-friendly summary**.
  - **GCP Function Guide**: [How to Run a GCP Function](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/quickstart)
  - Setup Steps:
    1. Enable **Cloud Healthcare NLP API** in GCP.
    2. Create **Service Account** and download credentials.
    3. Deploy backend using Node.js (steps below).

### ðŸ¤– **AI Chatbot (Gemini Integration)**
- **Status**: Implementation done .

## ðŸ›  **Setting Up Development Environment**
- Ensure your system meets the **Node.js and Firebase CLI requirements**.
- Clone the repository and navigate to the backend folder:
```sh
cd src/backend
```
- Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```
- Run the backend service:
```sh
node app.js
```

## ðŸ“² **Expo Development Build Setup**
Since the application requires **advanced Expo libraries**, ensure your setup includes:
- **Expo EAS services**: Setting up EAS credentials is required for the expo dev build .
- **Expo Libraries Used**: `expo-speech`, `expo-share`, `expo-print`, `expo-location`, etc.
- **Install EAS CLI**:
```sh
npx expo install -g eas-cli
```
- **Login to EAS**:
```sh
eas login
```
- **Build Platform for Android**:
```sh
eas build -p android
```
- **Use the generated APK** to run the application.
